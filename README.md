# React Native Typescript Mobx Stores

This is a React Native Typescript app configured with mobx stores using the `<Provider>` and `React.Context` patterns. The `RootStore` [pattern](https://mobx.js.org/defining-data-stores.html) is used to combine individual domain stores into a singleton to share their references.

It demonstrates a `<Text>` component using three different approaches:

- `withStore()` - For legacy class components where each store is destructured into props
- `useStore()` - For functional components using hooks
- `import { myStore } from "./stores"` - Direct import of stores
